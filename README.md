# Wizloft Harness — Starter Repository

Wizloft Harness is a generic, agent-agnostic engineering harness for Wizloft projects.
It is not a coding agent runtime. It makes repositories easier for humans and agents to understand, govern, validate, remember, and evolve.

## Core principles

```text
Events     = what happened
Memory     = what we learned
Repository = what we have decided is true
```

- The repository is the source of truth.
- Memory is first-class but never outranks repository authority.
- The kernel is small; project-specific behavior composes through plugins.
- Harness is agent-agnostic. Codex, Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness, and future runtimes are integrations/adapters, not kernel assumptions.
- Wizloft Harness owns command semantics; Wizloft CLI owns command names and executable UX.
- DeepSeek Harness is an architecture reference and future interoperability target, not a v0 dependency.

## Development strategy

```text
1. Build Minimum Useful Harness (MUH)
2. Use Harness on itself
3. Use Harness to rebuild wizloft-cli in TypeScript
4. Harden Harness from real friction
5. Use the hardened Harness to implement Meldmark
```

Start with [`START-HERE.md`](START-HERE.md), then [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Development

The Slice 0 workspace requires Node.js 22.13 or newer and pnpm 11.10 or newer.

```bash
npm install --global pnpm@11.10.0 # skip when a compatible pnpm is already installed
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```

`pnpm verify` is the CI-ready root contract for Biome checks, TypeScript type checking, tests,
and builds. Use `pnpm check:fix` to apply safe formatting, lint, and import-organization fixes.
